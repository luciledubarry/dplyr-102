```{r}
#| message: false
here::i_am("dplyr-102.Rproj")
library(here)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(vroom)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Data loading
```{r}
#| message: false
clients <- vroom(here("data", "client.csv"))
disp <- vroom(here("data", "disp.csv"))
accounts <- vroom(here("data", "account.csv"))
```

## Joining data tables
A collection of joining functions of the form `*_join`

### Inner join
```{r}
#| message: false
da <- inner_join(accounts, disp)
```
If we obtain an incoherent number of rows, there could a problem with delimitation, must use the delim function. 

```{r}
cda <- inner_join(clients, da, by = join_by(client_id), suffix = c("_home", "_bank"))
```
make the joining on a specific variable, would create 2 variables id_district (because are in common in both tables)

suffix function = differentiate name of common vraibales between 2 tables
